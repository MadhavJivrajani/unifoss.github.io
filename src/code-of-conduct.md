# Code of Conduct

## Why?

We want to ensure your experience at UniFOSS leaves you happy and satisfied. We aim to ensure every participant in this movement feels safe and welcome.

Having this Code of Conduct also helps you know what our standards for acceptable behaviour are, as well as provide a clear picture of how we enforce this.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all communication channels, Special Interest Groups, events, meetups or any activity that operate under the UniFOSS name.

It also applies to individuals representing UniFOSS in public spaces. Examples of this include using an official social media handle or email address, or acting as an appointed representative of UniFOSS for any event.

This Code of Conduct does *not* apply to any Unit of UniFOSS. You will have to refer to the Code of Conduct for that particular Unit to know about what is considered acceptable.

## Our Standards

### For individuals

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Helping people learn something new, without being judgemental
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Use of microaggressions, especially with an intent to make others feel unwelcome

### For Units

Activities of Units are not subject to this Code of Conduct, but it is a mandatory requirement that Units have their own Code of Conduct that is promptly enforced.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [NEEDSWORK, make email ID].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### For Units

A Unit may receive up to two warnings for not effectively enforcing their Code of Conduct.

If no corrective action is taken, the Unit will be disaffiliated from UniFOSS.
